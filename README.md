**Stock Market Prediction Project**  

This project focuses on building a predictive model for stock price movements using historical market data and machine learning techniques. By analyzing patterns in stock prices, trading volumes, and other financial indicators, the model aims to forecast future price trends. Key components of the project include data collection and preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection (e.g., linear regression, neural networks, or LSTM), and performance evaluation. The goal is to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
